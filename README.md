## Algorithm & Data Structures

> Yay! Its the first day of 2018.

I have compiled together a comprehensive list of standard Algorithm and Data Structures below. As a new year resolution, my goal will be to implement all of these using python. Furthermore, as I go deeper down the list, I will be adding links to article and video resources, that I used to understand these concepts. 

### Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis
Before even getting started implementing these algorithms, its important to know about these topics :  
- [HackerRank - Big O (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw&t=3s)
